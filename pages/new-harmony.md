<h2>New Harmony, Indiana</h2>
<p>After US victories in the region during the War of 1812 and Tecumseh's War, the Indiana frontier was opened for American settlement. The availability of land drew a diverse array of settlers, including the founders of New Harmonyâ€”utopians who sought to create a perfect society on the banks of the Wabash River.</p>

<p>New Harmony was first established by the Harmonie Society, a group of German religious separatists, in 1814. In 1825, the town was sold to social reformer Robert Owen, who attempted to build a model community based on principles of equality, education, and communal living. Though the utopian experiment ultimately dissolved, New Harmony became a center for scientific and educational innovation in the Midwest.</p>

<p>Trade along the Ohio and Wabash Rivers brought luxury items all the way to the frontier. In the early 1800s, such luxury goods were rare and typically the domain of skilled artisans. Ivory items, in particular, were prized for their beauty and craftsmanship. Some of the finest ivory workers in the world at the time were French artisans, renowned for their skill in carving and turning ivory into exquisite objects such as combs, fans, and piano keys.</p>
