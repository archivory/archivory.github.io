    <h1>Geib Flute</h1>

    <p>John Geib and Sons exemplify the old way of musicians working with ivoryâ€”an integrated process led by a single artisan. Geib was a key player in the hyper-competitive musical instrument market of early 19th century New York. The company's eclipse before the Civil War foreshadowed the rise of industrial giants like Pratt, Read, &amp; Co. and Comstock, Cheney, &amp; Co.</p>
