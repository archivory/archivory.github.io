We are grateful for the support of the Eskenazi Museum of Art, the Monroe County Historical Museum, Newfields, the Field Museum, the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, and other partners and citizens who volunteered their expertise, oral histories, and heirlooms for testing. 

We would also like to give a special shout-out to the Porter County Museum for their kind donation of an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/Ivory_Cane.jpg" target="_blank">ivory cane</a>.

We would also like to thank our programming partners for their collaboration and support:
