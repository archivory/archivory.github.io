# Zanzibar and the Ivory Trade

Following its establishment as the capital of the Omani Empire in 1840, Zanzibar quickly became one of the most important cities in the international ivory trade. The Omani sultans transformed Zanzibar into a thriving mercantile hub, overseeing the movement of ivory from the African interior to global markets. The city's port was the primary gateway for ivory exports to Europe, North America, and Asia, and its influence shaped trade routes, economies, and cultures across continents. Zanzibar's strategic position and commercial leadership made it a focal point for traders, merchants, and companies seeking access to the lucrative ivory trade throughout the 19th century.

## Export Giants: Pratt, Read & Co. and Comstock, Cheney & Co.

Two of the most prominent American companies involved in the ivory trade were Pratt, Read & Co. and Comstock, Cheney & Co., both based in Connecticut. These firms imported vast quantities of ivory from Zanzibar, which was then processed into piano keys, combs, and other luxury goods. Their operations linked the economies of East Africa and New England, shaping the history of both regions.

- **Pratt, Read & Co.**: Founded in the early 19th century, this company became one of the world's largest manufacturers of piano keys, relying heavily on ivory imported from Zanzibar.
- **Comstock, Cheney & Co.**: Another major Connecticut-based ivory processor, Comstock, Cheney & Co. was a leader in the production of ivory goods and played a significant role in the transatlantic ivory trade.


## Cosmopolitan Center and Cultural Legacy

Zanzibar was not only a commercial hub, but also a cosmopolitan city that attracted traders, scholars, and travelers from across the Indian Ocean world. The city’s markets bustled with goods from Africa, Arabia, India, and beyond, and its diverse population reflected centuries of migration and exchange. The Omani sultans invested in the city’s infrastructure, building palaces, mosques, and warehouses to support the booming trade. The legacy of the ivory trade, and the global connections forged in Zanzibar, can still be seen in the city’s architecture, culture, and communities today.

## Enduring Impact

The history of Zanzibar’s ivory trade is a story of global commerce, cultural exchange, and environmental change. The city’s role as a gateway for ivory shaped the destinies of people and places far beyond its shores, leaving a lasting imprint on the world.

The legacy of these companies and the trade routes they established can still be traced in the material culture and history of both Zanzibar and Connecticut today.
