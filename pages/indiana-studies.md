  <h1>Indiana Studies</h1>
  <p>We are studying the collections of ivory in the state of Indiana to better understand the state's history through the observable data of ivory across time. By examining artifacts, craft goods, and industrial products made with ivory, we uncover stories about Indiana's people, economy, and cultural connections from early statehood to the industrial era.</p>

  <h2>Early Statehood</h2>
  <p>During Indiana's early statehood, ivory objects were rare and often imported, reflecting the aspirations and connections of settlers. These items included personal adornments, small tools, and keepsakes that traveled with families as they established new communities.</p>

  <h2>Frontier Craft Goods</h2>
  <p>As Indiana's frontier developed, local craftspeople began to incorporate ivory into their work. Ivory was used in knife handles, sewing tools, and decorative items, blending practicality with artistry and connecting Indiana to global trade networks.</p>

  <h2>Starr Piano</h2>
  <p>The Starr Piano Company, based in Richmond, Indiana, became a major industrial user of ivory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ivory keys produced by Starr Piano are found in instruments across the country, representing Indiana's role in music history and manufacturing.</p>

  <h2>Industrial Period</h2>
  <p>With the rise of industry, ivory use expanded into mass-produced goods, including combs, buttons, and piano keys. Indiana's factories and workshops contributed to the broader story of ivory in American life, while also raising questions about conservation and ethical sourcing.</p>
