# Bagamoyo: Gateway to the Coast

Bagamoyo was one of the most important coastal cities in East Africa, serving as a major starting point for ivory caravans heading to the Indian Ocean. Traders and porters brought ivory from the interior to Bagamoyo, where it was shipped to Zanzibar and onward to global markets. The city's strategic location made it a vital link in the international ivory trade, connecting inland Africa to the world.

Of the Swahili city states, Bagamoyo was least controlled by Oman, but was nevertheless the most prosperous. Caravans began arriving in 1800 for ivory, and were using the city as a staging point for voyages to the interior by mid-century. The city thus became one of the most important terminals of the ivory trade, and was the preferred place of embankment for ivory caravans through the central route. The city had a floating population of 12,000 ivory porters per week. Financial houses and ivory profits led to the emergence of a local elite. By 1888, the city's ivory stock was 140,000 kg- compared to 8,000 in Mombasa (1857) and 174,000 in Zanzibar (1862).
