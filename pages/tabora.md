# Tabora: Crossroads of the Caravan Trade

Tabora was a major inland trading center and crossroads for the ivory trade in East Africa. Caravans from the interior converged in Tabora before heading to Bagamoyo and Zanzibar. The city's role as a hub for traders, merchants, and porters made it essential to the movement of ivory and other goods across the continent and beyond.
