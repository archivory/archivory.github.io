<h1>Database</h1>
<p>The database unites curatorial records and scientific analyses of ivory objects into one open platform. It is designed to:</p> 

- Track change over time — for example, shifts in ivory fan production between 18th- and 19th-century Europe
- Reveal hidden connections — using multimodal machine learning to cluster data, such as by spotting visual cues in 18th- and 19th-century Chinese fans 

As new tests and data are added, the database will continue to grow and evolve. More functional and exciting tools are coming soon!
