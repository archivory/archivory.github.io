    <p>Found at the Fort Wayne Historical Society in Indiana, this sword is representative of the first typology of ivory artifact in the region. In the 1750s, English and French forces massed for combat, vying for control of the vital Ohio River Valley. Ivory-gripped weapons, such as this sword, symbolize this historical development and the cultural significance of ivory in weaponry.</p>
