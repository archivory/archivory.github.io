# English 1803 Sword


This English Model 1803 sword is a significant artifact that reflects upon a major chapter in American history. The Model 1803 was a British sword that was used not only in the Napoleonic Wars, but also by light infantry and cavalry units in the War of 1812 in North America. 

Prior to the War of 1812, American settlers and military forces had worked to consolidate control of the region west of the Ohio River. Victories over the Miami at the Battle of Fallen Timbers and Tippecanoe alarmed the British, who began making preparations for war. 

In the years that followed, Indiana was the stage for the Western theater of hostilities. Difficult campaigns saw US military forces engage against the British and their native allies at sites like Fort Wayne and Fort Harrison, and in the near-abroad in battles for Detroit and Lake Erie. 

Although the results of direct hostilities between the US and Great Britain were mixed, the war did result in the death of Tecumseh and the end of organized native resistance in the lower midwest. Ivory presided over this final chapter of colonization in Indiana much the way it had the first- in combat.
