# Ivory Fan

This intricately carved ivory fan originated from New Harmony, Indiana, and is dated between 1819 and 1895. The fan is a remarkable example of 19th-century craftsmanship and reflects the global trade networks that brought luxury goods like ivory to communities in Indiana. Its presence in New Harmony highlights the town's unique history as a center for social experimentation and cultural exchange during the 19th century.
