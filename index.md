<h1>Welcome to ArchIvory</h1>

<p>At ArchIvory, we are pioneering a mixed methods approach that integrates techniques from social sciences, archaeological science, and data science. By leveraging innovative tools such as x-ray fluorescence, we are uncovering new possibilities in historical studies.</p>

<p>Our research enables us to trace the historical movement of ivory across places and times, even delving into the lives of the elephants from which the material originated. This groundbreaking work sheds light on the intricate connections between humans, animals, and the environment throughout history.</p>
